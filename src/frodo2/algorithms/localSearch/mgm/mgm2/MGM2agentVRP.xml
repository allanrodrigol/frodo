<!-- Overall definition of the agent
	- measureTime: whether the simulated time metric should be enabled instead of just measuring wall clock time
	- measureMsgs: whether to measure the number of messages and the total amount of information sent (WARNING! This is computationally expensive)

	<!-- The XCSP parser that supports VRP constraints 
		- displayGraph: if true, displays the constraint graph in DOT format (default = false)
		- domClass: the class to be used for variable values (must be AddableInteger)
		- utilClass: the class to be used for utility values (should be AddableReal or AddableBigDecimal)
		- DOTrenderer: the class to be used to display the constraint graph. Supported values:
			- empty string: displays the constraint graph in DOT format in the console; 
			- frodo2.gui.DOTrenderer: renders the constraint graph in a new window. Assumes that Graphviz' "dot" command is on the shell path. 
		- countNCCCs: whether Non-Concurrent Constraint Checks should be counted (default = false)

	<!-- A set of modules, each being parameterized by the following attributes:

		- messages (optional): a list of "message" elements, each parameterized by the following attributes: 
			- name: the name of the public static String field in the module that identifies the message
			- value: the type to be used for that message
			- ownerClass (optional): if present, specifies the name of a class, and the attribute "value" is then interpreted as a public static String field of that class
